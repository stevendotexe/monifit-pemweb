    ```

4.  **Setup your environment file:**
    -   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Generate a new application key:
        ```bash
        php artisan key:generate
        ```

5.  **Configure your database:**
    -   Create a new database for the project.
    -   Update the following variables in your `.env` file:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
    ```

7.  **Run the development servers:**
    This single command starts both the PHP and Vite servers.
